# Heart-Failure-
Predicting Heart Failure using LDA

## Approach:
- Developed a machine learning model to predict heart disease risk using key clinical predictors.
- Applied Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and validated its assumptions, confirming a primarily linear relationship between predictors and heart disease.
- Utilized LASSO regression for feature selection, simplifying the model while maintaining predictive accuracy.
- Compared performance with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, confirming that complex, non-linear models did not improve results.

## Findings:
- Achieved 83.33% accuracy using only the most linear predictors: ejection fraction, high blood pressure, and time.
- Demonstrated the potential of interpretable, data-driven models to aid in clinical risk assessment and patient stratification for heart disease.
